# Cafe Order Tracker Dashboard

## Overview:
This project involves creating a simple dashboard to track cafe orders using a dataset with 50 rows. The goal was to gain actionable insights from the cafe’s sales data by using statistical methods and visualizing the results. The dashboard tracks **order types**, **total revenue**, and the **number of orders** at different times of the day.

## Problem:
The cafe was unable to efficiently track sales trends and identify peak times for different order types. The aim was to create an easy-to-use dashboard that could visualize key order metrics and offer valuable insights for business decision-making.

## Solution:
I developed an interactive dashboard in **Excel** using statistical analysis and visualizations to track:
- **Order Type Distribution**: Analyzes revenue across different order types (Delivery, Dine-In, Take-Away).
- **Order Frequency by Time of Day**: Shows how many orders are placed at different times (Morning, Afternoon, Evening, Night).
- **Bill Trends Across Orders**: Displays trends in total bill amounts over time.
- **Key Insights**:
  - **Dine-In Orders** generated the highest revenue (₹87,826).
  - **Evening time** had the highest number of orders (15 orders).
  - Customer age has minimal impact on the final bill (R² = 0.012).

### Statistical Approach Used:
- **Mean & Median**: Calculated the average order value and customer spending.
- **Mode**: Identified the most frequent order types and times.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Examined the relationship between customer age and final bill, finding minimal impact (R² = 0.012).

### Key Features:
- **Revenue by Order Type**: Bar charts showing revenue split by Delivery, Dine-In, and Take-Away orders.
- **Number of Orders by Time of Day**: A bar chart to visualize which times have the highest order frequency.
- **Order Trends**: A line chart showing the trend of total bills across orders.
- **Key Insights**: Summary of the most significant findings from the data analysis.

### Tools & Technologies Used:
- **Excel** (PivotTables, Charts, Data Analysis)
- **Statistical Analysis**: Mean, Median, Mode, and Correlation Analysis

## Results/Impact:
- Identified **peak times** for orders and adjusted staffing accordingly.
- Gained insights into **revenue generation** across order types, helping with menu and pricing strategy.
- **Minimal correlation** between **customer age** and **final bill** suggests other factors influence spending behavior more.

## Future Improvements:
- **Increase Dataset Size**: Expand the dataset to include **monthly data** for better trend analysis.
- **Real-Time Data Integration**: Connect the dashboard to a live sales data feed for real-time analysis.
- **Predictive Analytics**: Introduce **machine learning models** to predict order trends and customer spending patterns.
